# DFW Data Analyst Market Intelligence Analysis 
#### SQL + Excel Market Intelligence Project

---

## Executive Summary
An analysis of 2023 Data Analyst job postings across major cities within the Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW) metroplex using SQL for data extraction and Excel for modeling and visualization.

The analysis segments the market by city to compare job volume, salary levels, industry concentration, skill requirements, and hiring cycles across key DFW business hubs.

The findings translate job posting data into clear signals about how analysts can position themselves competitively within different city markets.



## Tools Used
**SQL**
- Data cleaning  
- Filtering & grouping  
- Aggregation (COUNT, AVG)  
- Skill frequency extraction  
- City & industry segmentation  

🔍 Query scripts supporting this analysis are located in the [project_sql folder](/project_sql/) directory.


**Microsoft Excel**
- Pivot tables  
- Data modeling  
- Salary comparison  
- Dashboard-style visualizations  
- Monthly and quarterly trend analysis  



## Data Sources

- Dataset: 2023 Data Analytics job postings compiled by Luke Barousse.
- Geographic scope narrowed to major DFW cities through independent filtering and segmentation.
- Analytical framework and conclusions independently developed.



## Geographic Demand & Compensation Analysis

</p>

The analysis compares major DFW cities and reveals clear differences in both job volume and compensation.

Dallas and Irving show the highest concentration of postings, while several smaller cities demonstrate higher average salaries for certain roles.

This highlights how opportunity density and compensation potential vary by location within the same metro area.



## Industry Market Share

</p>

Financial Services and Staffing account for a significant share of hiring demand.

The DFW market relies heavily on analysts to support operations, reporting, and performance tracking. The demand is business-driven rather than product-focused.

Candidates who understand metrics, reporting workflows, and decision support are well aligned with this market structure.



## Skill Demand vs Salary Premium

</p>

SQL appears most frequently across postings, confirming it as a baseline requirement.

Cloud platforms such as Azure, AWS, and Snowflake appear less often but correlate with higher average salaries.

The pattern is clear:

- SQL enables entry into the market.
- Advanced infrastructure skills increase compensation leverage.
- Depth of skill is more valuable than listing many tools.

  </tr>
</table>

Hiring activity peaks in Q1 and Q2 and slows in Q4, aligning with corporate budget cycles.

While response rates may vary throughout the year, hiring remains active across all quarters.



## Strategic Career Positioning
The DFW market rewards candidates who:

- Demonstrate strong SQL fundamentals  
- Use Excel effectively for business reporting  
- Communicate insights through clear visualization  
- Develop cloud or modern data platform skills  
- Understand how timing and location influence opportunity  

This analysis connects technical skill development directly to measurable hiring demand.



## Assumptions & Data Notes

- The dataset does not capture every Data Analyst posting in DFW during 2023.
- Postings without salary information were excluded for consistent salary comparison.
- Some salaries reflect ranges rather than fixed compensation.
- Reposted roles may appear more than once.
- Skills were extracted directly from job descriptions and may contain repetition.
- Findings reflect 2023 data and may not represent current conditions.

These considerations were factored into the interpretation of results.
